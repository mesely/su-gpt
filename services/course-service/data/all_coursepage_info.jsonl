Students will explore the historical development of \nevolutionary thought, beginning with pre-Darwinian ideas and \nmoving through Darwin's contributions to the Modern \nSynthesis. This unit also introduces the construction and \ninterpretation of phylogenetic trees as tools for \nunderstanding evolutionary relationships. In Unit II: How \nEvolution Works, the course examines the fundamental \nmechanisms of evolution. Topics include the origins of \ngenetic variation through mutation and recombination, \nand the population-level processes of natural selection, \ngenetic drift, and gene flow. Students will learn how these \nforces interact to shape allele frequencies and phenotypic \ntraits across generations, supported by population genetics \nmodels and equilibrium theory. Unit III: The Products of \nEvolution focuses on the processes that generate biological \ndiversity. Students will study the definition and formation \nof species, mechanisms of reproductive isolation, and modes \nof speciation. Additionally, this unit introduces \nevolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo), exploring how \ngenetic and regulatory changes lead to morphological \ninnovation and complexity. In Unit IV: Interactions Between \nIndividuals and Species, the course delves into the \nevolutionary consequences of social and ecological \ninteractions. Topics include sexual selection and the \nevolution of mating strategies, kin selection, altruism, and \nthe emergence of cooperation. Students will also examine \nhow interspecies dynamics such as predation, mutualism, \nand coevolution drive evolutionary change. Unit V: The \nHistory of Life provides a macroevolutionary perspective, \ntracing the deep history of life on Earth. Students will \nlearn about the Tree of Life, major evolutionary transitions \n(such as multicellularity and terrestrialization), and \nadaptive radiations. The unit also explores mass extinctions \nand how they have shaped the diversity of life through \nmacroevolutionary processes. Finally, Unit VI: Evolution of \nHomo sapiens addresses human evolution from an evolutionary \nbiology perspective. Students will study the fossil and \ngenetic evidence for human origins, population divergence, \nand adaptation. This unit also introduces concepts in \nevolutionary medicine and discusses how evolutionary \ntheory applies to health, disease, and ethics in modern \nsociety.", "prerequisites": null, "corequisites": null, "last_offered_terms": [{"term": "Spring 2025-2026", "course_name": "Evolution", "su_credit": 3.0}], "source_url": "https://suis.sabanciuniv.edu/prod/sabanci_www.p_get_courses?levl_code=UG&subj_code=BIO&crse_numb=460&lang=eng", "scraped_at": "2026-01-26T12:28:19.598431+00:00"}

It critically traces the shift from in-kind \nassistance to cash-based programming and market-oriented \ninterventions, assessing their implications for dignity, \nlocal economies, and humanitarian effectiveness. Through a \nmultidisciplinary lens, students examine how crises disrupt \nmarkets and livelihoods, while foregrounding the economic \nagency of refugees and displaced populations who actively \nnavigate formal and informal economies beyond humanitarian \nassistance. Drawing on case studies from the MENA region, \nTurkey, Africa, and Europe, the course follows the full arc \nof crisis response, from emergency intervention through \nprotracted displacement to recovery and reconstruction. Key \ndebates include localization, inequality within the \nhumanitarian workforce, profit and power in aid systems, \nand the political economy of humanitarian action. The course \nalso explores humanitarian logistics, financial inclusion, \nand the growing role of digital and fintech tools in aid \ndelivery.
